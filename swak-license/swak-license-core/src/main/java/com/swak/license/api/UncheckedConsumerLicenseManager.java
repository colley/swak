 * Defines the life cycle management operations for license keys in consumer applications.

 * An unchecked consumer license manager generally throws an {@link UncheckedLicenseManagementException} with a
 * (checked) {@link LicenseManagementException} as its cause if an operation fails.
 *
 * <h2>How to Preview License Keys</h2>
 * <p>
 * This interface intentionally lacks a method to preview the license bean which is encoded in a license key.
 * You can work around this constraint by using a {@linkplain LicenseManagementContext license management context} to
 * configure a consumer license manager which uses a transient memory store instead of a persistent store - see
 * {@link ConsumerLicenseManagerBuilder#storeIn}.
 * Once configured, you can {@linkplain #install install} the license key to the transient memory store and
 * {@linkplain #load load} its encoded license bean.
 *
 * @see ConsumerLicenseManager#unchecked()
