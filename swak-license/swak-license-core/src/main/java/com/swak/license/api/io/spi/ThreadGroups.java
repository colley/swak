     * Determines a suitable thread group for <i>server threads</i> which provide shared services for one or more

     * <p>
     * When a server thread gets spawned from a client thread and no particular thread group is selected, then it gets
     * inherited from the client thread to the server thread.
     * However, this may be inappropriate if the server thread has a longer life time than the client thread or if it's
     * shared by other client threads in different thread groups.
     * This method can then get used in order to determine a suitable thread group for the server thread.
     * <p>
     * This method searches for the top level accessible parent thread group by calling {@link #getThreadGroup()} and
     * walking up the parent thread group hierarchy until the next parent does not exist or is inaccessible.
     * If there is a security manager installed, then this method typically returns its directly associated thread group
     * because this is the only accessible one.
     * Otherwise, this method typically returns the root thread group.
     *
     * @return The result of the search for the top level accessible parent thread group, starting with the thread group
     *         of the security manager if installed or else the thread group of the current thread and walking up the
     *         parent thread group hierarchy until the next parent does not exist or is inaccessible.
