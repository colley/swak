/**
 * A value object which defines and provides the common properties of any license.
 * All properties are set to {@code null} by default.
 * However, {@linkplain LicenseValidation#validate license validation} may fail if some properties are {@code null} when
 * {@linkplain VendorLicenseManager#generateKeyFrom generating}, {@linkplain ConsumerLicenseManager#install installing}
 * or {@linkplain ConsumerLicenseManager#verify verifying} license keys.
 * <p>
 * There are two options for extending a license with custom properties:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The easiest way is to put the custom properties in a {@linkplain java.util.Map map} or another JavaBean and store
 * it in the {@linkplain #setExtra(Object) extra} property (composition).
 * <li>Another option is to subclass this class and add the custom properties (inheritance).
 * However, you may then need to override {@link #equals(Object)}, too.
 * If you do, you also need to override {@link #hashCode()} for consistency.
 * </ul>
 * Either way, the custom properties must be supported by the {@link Codec} of the respective license key format - see
 * {@link LicenseManagementContext#codec}.
 * This is easiest to achieve if the respective class follows the JavaBean pattern just like this interface does.
